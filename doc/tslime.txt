*tslime.txt*  Plugin to send text from Vim to a running tmux session

INTRODUCTION                                            *tslime*

This plugin allows you to easily copy text from a Vim buffer into a pane in a
running tmux session. It can be used to communicate with a shell, interactive
interpreter, or REPL.

Before sending text to tmux for the first time, you will be prompted to select a
target session, window, and pane. From then on, all text sent to tmux will go to
that target automatically. You can use a mapping or a command to select a new
target.

MAPPINGS                                                *tslime-mappings*

This fork of tslime does not provide default mappings. Instead, it defines
the following |<Plug>| mappings:

<Plug>SendSelectionToTmux
                        Sends the current visual-mode selection to tmux.

<Plug>NormalModeSendToTmux
                        Sends the paragraph under the cursor to tmux.

<Plug>TslimeOperator{motion}
                        Sends the text covered by {motion} to tmux.

<Plug>SetTmuxVars       Prompts for a new target session, window, and pane.

COMMANDS                                                *tslime-commands*

                                                        *:SetTmuxVars*
:SetTmuxVars            Prompts for a new target session, window, and pane.

                                                        *:Tmux*
:Tmux {text}            Sends {text} to tmux, followed by a <CR>.

OPTIONS                                                 *tslime-options*

You can set the following global variables in your |vimrc| to make selecting
targets easier:

*g:tslime_always_current_session*
                        When selecting a target, always choose the current
                        tmux session without prompting.

*g:tslime_always_current_window*
                        When selecting a target, always choose the current
                        tmux window without prompting.
