*tslime.txt*  Plugin to send text from Vim to a running tmux session

INTRODUCTION                                            *tslime*

This plugin allows you to easily copy text from a Vim buffer into a pane in a
running tmux session. It can be used to communicate with a shell, interactive
interpreter, or REPL.

Before sending text to tmux for the first time, you will be prompted to select
a target session, window, and pane. From then on, all text sent to tmux will
go to that target automatically. You can use the |:TslimeChooseTarget| command
to select a new target.

MAPPINGS                                                *tslime-mappings*

This fork of tslime does not provide default mappings. Instead, it defines
the following |<Plug>| mappings:

<Plug>(TslimeSendSelection)
                        Sends the current visual-mode selection to tmux.

<Plug>(TslimeOperator){motion}
                        Sends the text covered by {motion} to tmux.

                                                        *tslime-mappings-example*
To use these, you will need to create your own mappings for them. For example,
to use "\t" to send text to tmux in both visual and normal mode, you can use
the following mappings: >

   xmap \t <Plug>(TslimeSendSelection)
   nmap \t <Plug>(TslimeOperator)

COMMANDS                                                *tslime-commands*

                                                        *:TslimeSend*
:[range]TslimeSend      Send the current buffer to tmux. With [range], send
                        only the specified lines.
                                                        *:TslimeChooseTarget*
:TslimeChooseTarget     Prompts for a new target session, window, and pane.

OPTIONS                                                 *tslime-options*

You can set the following global variables in your |vimrc| to make selecting
targets easier:

*g:tslime_always_current_session*
                        When selecting a target, always choose the current
                        tmux session without prompting.

*g:tslime_always_current_window*
                        When selecting a target, always choose the current
                        tmux window without prompting.
